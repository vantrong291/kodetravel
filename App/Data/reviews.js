      "Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by Sibiu Guide Nico , our names were mentioned on the board and we felt welcomed and with such a friendly atmosphere we had a fantastic start! The guide and tour was extremely good, very flexible (appreciate this!) and for that she deserves a special thanks. We had two great days there, which obviously also added up to the experience.\n" +
      "Nico is such a warm personality and highly motivated guide (recommendable!). I truly enjoyed walking the six of us through the area. The scenery was beautiful and it was a relieve to walk in such a quiet and peaceful environment. The natural bath on the end was a great way to end the tour.\n" +
      "The atmosphere is so special that it really felt like home to all of us. All respect for Nico who does a great job there; a true sample of excellent tour guide!\n" +
      "Many thanks again and I recommend Sibiu Guide Nico to everyone!",
