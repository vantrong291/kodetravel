        reviewContent: 'Du lịch phải là tham gia những hoạt động tham quan, vui chơi giải trí ban ngày tại những địa điểm nổi tiếng chuyên được khai thác phục vụ du khách? Quan niệm này giờ đã không còn đúng khi sự phát triển của các hoạt động về đêm ngày càng được quan tâm chú trọng. Tương tự, đến với Hội An, bạn cũng nhất định đừng bỏ qua 6 trải nghiệm khi “mặt trời khuất núi” được báo nước ngoài hết lời gợi ý sau đây để có một chuyến đi trọn vẹn.\nKhông ít khách du lịch trong và ngoài nước đã phải sửng sốt trước vẻ đẹp Hội An khi ánh mặt trời dần được thay thế bởi những ngọn đèn đường, và khẳng định vẻ đẹp ấy thậm chí còn lung linh và cuốn hút hơn gấp bội lúc trời sáng. Vì vậy dạo bộ quanh các con đường khi phố đã lên đèn là lựa chọn của nhiều người.',
